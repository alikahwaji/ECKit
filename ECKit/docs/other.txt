Other than what is included in the other Docs, Here's the rest of what you may need to know:

Font:
    The font is set to these defaults:
      In this order:
      Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Liberation Sans, Arial, sans-serif
      
    For the font classes to work, you must remove these lines:
    
    body{
      font-family:"Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Liberation Sans, Arial, sans-serif";
    }
    
    These lines are in settings.less in the source or starting on line 474 is style.css
