12 Column Grid System
-

The 12 column grid system is what the 2.0.X versions start with.

To get the 12 column grid system to work above 2.0.1, just make sure you downloaded the ECKit.12col.X.zip file (X stands for current version) and have extracted the files.

The 12 column system is easy to implement. The index.html that the .zip file comes with is a great starting point for creating your website.

Columns

There can be "12" (obviously) different columns in this distro of ECKit.

Here's how a basic setup of ECKit is:

	<div class="row">
	
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
		<div class="col span_1"><p>Lorem Ipsum</div>
	
	</div>
	
If you put that in the index.html you'd see 12 rows all saying Lorem Ipsum.
	
----------------------
Here's how that works:
The main div has the class "row", so there can not be any other columns in that part but the ones inside that div.

The div tags inside all have the "col" span so they can be known as columns. They also have the "span_1" class, so they all span only 1 column width. To change any width, just change the 1 in "span_1" to any number 1 through 12, 1 being the smallest, 12 being the largest.
