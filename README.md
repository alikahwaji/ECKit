##Notes About ECKit
Here's some VERY notable things about ECKit:

1. ECKit does not use CC3 (as of now), and it is still supported by most legacy (ie. IE 6/7/8) browsers.
2. ECKit is worked on daily, so you can expect plenty of new features with every release.
3. ECKit as of date has had no found bug to date.
4. ECKit uses other projects of ECWS that are still not on github, but expect them soon.
